## How to execute Project

We still recommend reading the comments in the main file first. If all dependencys are installed, navigate into this Project folder.
Execute the `main.py` or the variations `main_real_reachy.py`, `main_simulation.py`

```shell
python3 Pythonscripts/main.py
```

## Installation Guide for the Unity Project

1. Download the Unity package available on the [release page](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/Simulator_Reachy2021/releases). Download the [grpc_unity_package](https://packages.grpc.io/archive/2022/04/67538122780f8a081c774b66884289335c290cbe-f15a2c1c-582b-4c51-acf2-ab6d711d2c59/csharp/grpc_unity_package.2.47.0-dev202204190851.zip) from the gRPC daily builds.
2. In your Unity Project import the unity package via Assets (From the menu Assets/Import Package/Custom Packageâ€¦, import reachy2021-simulator.unitypackage)
3. Add grpc_unity_package (plugins) via drag and drop in the Assets folder of the project window.

The Assets folder should look like this:

```shell
Assets
|
+--- ...
|
+--- Plugins  (grpc module)
|
+--- ReachySimulator 
|
+--- ...
```
